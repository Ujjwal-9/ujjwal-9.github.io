## Latent Space Poisoning
I conceptualized and developed an adversarial attack which used JointVAE architecture to search the latent space for potential examples which can fool the black box classifer. The work ended up beating PGD based defenses on various datasets (MNIST, CelebA, and SVHN) and reducing its success rate by ~70%.

As a member of the Proactively Addressing Substandard Housing (PASH) working group, I helped draft a city ordinance proposing the [Chicago Healthy Homes Inspection Program (CHHIP)](https://www.tenants-rights.org/programs/advocacy/chhip/), a universal rental housing inspection program to protect tenants from health hazards including lead. -->

In collaboration with the IIT Delhi, Marconi Society and Google, My team developed and performed validation of a predictive model to target safety systems on edge devices. The source code is available on GitHub. Our work was reported in the [India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/news/story/delhi-college-students-win-prestigious-marconi-awards-for-apps-on-women-safety-and-checking-air-pollution-1611854-2019-10-22), [The Hindu](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/variety/delhi-students-solutions-for-womens-safety-air-pollution-bag-marconi-societys-celestini-programme-awards/article29765200.ece), and [Financial Express](https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/benefits-of-connectivity-students-win-marconi-awards-for-innovative-apps/1747344/) among many others.
